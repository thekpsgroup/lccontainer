  { q: "Do you deliver statewide?", a: "Yes. We deliver across Texas with tilt-bed and crane options where needed. Enter your ZIP on any product page for a ballpark delivery range, and we'll confirm exact pricing in your quote." },
  { q: "What's the difference between Standard and High Cube?", a: "High Cube containers are 9'6\" tall (about 1 foot taller than Standard). If you need extra cubic capacity or want to add insulation and finish-out, High Cube is usually the move." },
  { q: "Used vs New (One-Trip) — which should I pick?", a: "Used (WWT) are wind & water tight, industrial-looking, and cost-effective. New (One-Trip) are cleaner, paint looks fresh, and great when presentation matters. Both are structurally solid." },
  { q: "How fast can I get a container?", a: "Typical delivery is 1–5 business days depending on location and yard schedule. If you're near DFW, same-week is common." },
  { q: "Site requirements for delivery?", a: "Solid, level ground with room to maneuver. For tilt-bed, plan ~120' straight line for a 40'. If access is tight, ask about crane set." },
  { q: "Do you handle custom builds?", a: "Yes. Roll-up doors, personnel doors, windows, insulation, paint, power, HVAC, and more. We'll scope it and provide an ETA in your quote." }
